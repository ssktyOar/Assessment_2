(1) In folder "My own code" is code that I wrote by myself. Below it's instruction and brief descrition.

______________1________________

Code in folders LightEngine, LightServer can be compiled using .NET 6.0 and C# 10. 

LightEngine is my first attempt in creating my own game engine, LightServer - same,

but using API Vulkan for providing calculations on GPU.


______________2________________

Client and Server is my attempts to create multiplyer game. Due to big size of project, there is only necessarry for Visual Studio files,

otherwise I wouldn't be able to uload them to GitHub.

Code itself you can find on Server/Assets/Scripts or Client/Assets/Scripts. In Server missing only one 68 MB file, so, 

if you want to compile it, please send me message on teams.



(2) My code mainly inspired by documentation and cde examples made by Microsoft C# for .NET (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/) and Unity for their engine (https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/index.html)

Concrete code examples from Microsoft:
	1) Example 1: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.sockets.tcpclient?view=net-7.0
	2) Example 2: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.filestream?view=net-7.0
	3) Example 3: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.dictionary-2?view=net-7.0

Concrete code examples from Unity:
	1) Example 1: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Physics.Raycast.html
	2) Example 2: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.AddForce.html
	3) https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/ContactPoint.html

(3) Code that I think is interesting is the code of rotation of 3D objects in Godot Engine (https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/3d/using_transforms.html)

I think that this is interesting because it can help me in future to write my own engine. However, I still do not understand how they are calculate rotation.

For this I need to understand how to rotate objects using quaternions.
